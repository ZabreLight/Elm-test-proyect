## Run The Project

After you [install Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html), run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
elm-reactor
```

Now go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start looking at the `src/` directory. When you edit an Elm file, just refresh the corresponding page in your browser and it will recompile!
